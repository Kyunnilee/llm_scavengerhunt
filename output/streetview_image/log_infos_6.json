Your objective is to locate a designated destination as efficiently as possible using the information provided at each step. Analyze visual and positional data carefully, decide on strategic actions to move closer to the goal, and make fully use of QA-system, ask questions to gather information you need.\n---\n**Task Rules**:\n1. **Input Information**: At each step, you will receive the following:\n   - **Current Position**: Your current location described textually.\n   - **Current Heading**: A number between -180 and 180 indicating the direction you are facing (0 = North, 90 = East, 180 = South, -90 = West).\n   - **Visual Information**: Five street view images corresponding to your surroundings:\n     - **Left**: 90 degrees counter-clockwise from your heading.\n     - **Left-forward**: 45 degrees counter-clockwise from your heading.\n     - **Front**: Aligned with your heading.\n     - **Right-forward**: 45 degrees clockwise from your heading.\n     - **Right**: 90 degrees clockwise from your heading.\n2. **Available Actions**:\n   - **forward**: Move one step forward to a new position.\n   - **left**/**right**/**turn_around**: Change your heading at the current position.\n   - **ask**: Ask QA-system a question for additional information. The content of the information depends on the question you ask, such as destination or environment. (Note): When you choose **ask**, you do not need to formulate a specific question immediately. Instead, this action signals your intent to gather information, and the system will provide an opportunity in the next step to clarify and specify the question.\n   - **stop**: Indicate that you have reached the destination or its vicinity.\n3. **Action-Specific Guidance**:\n   - If your action is **ask**, your current response should include only the decision `[Action: ask]` without crafting the specific question.\n   - The system will return a prompt in the next round for you to organize your question based on updated context and observations. This ensures your question is targeted and relevant.\n4. **Success Condition**: The task is considered successful if you choose **stop** when the destination is nearby.\n---\n**Strategy**:\n- Analyze the provided positional and visual data thoroughly before making any decision.\n- If unsure about the destination's location, use **ask** to gather essential information. Don't explore aimlessly, make good use of the QA-system as well as visual information, and use questions to get the information you need most at the moment! \n- Prioritize efficient movements and strategic questioning to achieve the goal with minimal steps.\n- It is recommended to ask questions at the beginning to determine the direction of the target before starting to move.\n---\n**Output Format**:\n1. **Analysis**: Summarize key observations (e.g., visible landmarks, directional clues, or features relevant to the target).\n2. **Reasoning**: Briefly explain the logic behind your chosen action.\n3. **Decision**: Format your action as `[Action: forward/left/right/turn_around/ask/stop]`, e.g., `[Action: ask]`.\n---\n**Current Target**: McDonald's"], "target_status": [false]}, {"step": 1, "log_root": "output\\logs\\20241214-000158_logs", "image_urls": ["https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/streetview?size=450x450&location=40.745684,-73.989662&key=AIzaSyBZdkQTQnrPBtfpmlPh5-Ngs5vdMO2Xy80&fov=90&heading=203&pitch=0&source=outdoor", "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/streetview?size=450x450&location=40.745684,-73.989662&key=AIzaSyBZdkQTQnrPBtfpmlPh5-Ngs5vdMO2Xy80&fov=90&heading=248&pitch=0&source=outdoor", "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/streetview?size=450x450&location=40.745684,-73.989662&key=AIzaSyBZdkQTQnrPBtfpmlPh5-Ngs5vdMO2Xy80&fov=90&heading=293&pitch=0&source=outdoor", "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/streetview?size=450x450&location=40.745684,-73.989662&key=AIzaSyBZdkQTQnrPBtfpmlPh5-Ngs5vdMO2Xy80&fov=90&heading=338&pitch=0&source=outdoor", "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/streetview?size=450x450&location=40.745684,-73.989662&key=AIzaSyBZdkQTQnrPBtfpmlPh5-Ngs5vdMO2Xy80&fov=90&heading=23&pitch=0&source=outdoor"], "message": ["The five images below show the view in different directions, they are on your left, front-left, front, front-right, and right.\nYou can take following action, only these actions are available in this position: \n[Action: forward], go to the new position in front of you.\n[Action: turn_around], turn to new direction in same position.\n[Action: ask], ask for more information.\n[Action: stop], report arrival.\n", "\"You're already very close to McDonald's!
