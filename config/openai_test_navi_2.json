Whenever you arrive at a new location, I will show you some images of the street around you, and tell you where you are and where you are heading. After thinking about it, you need to give your actions. Your possible actions are as follows: [forward, left, right, stop, lost]. Select forward to get to the next point of where you are currently facing, and select left/right to change your orientation. When you don't know how to act, you can choose the action `lost`, and then I will ask you what is the point of confusion, in the rest of the conversation, you need to ask questions to help you obtain information to decide on the action. As a reminder, you should only choose actions forward, left, or right if you have a concrete reason derived from the images and/or if I give you a specific instruction. This means that unless you are given explicit or implicit instructions on how to move or you can infer something from the images, you should select lost. Anything in the I say can be considered as factual and should be prioritized above everything else. This means if a prompt tells you to pick an option or gives you information that will lead to an option, you take it as fact and follow it. Finally, if you think you have reached your destination, use Action stop. You should give action at the end of your reply, the formulation should be like: [Action: YOU ACTION]."
